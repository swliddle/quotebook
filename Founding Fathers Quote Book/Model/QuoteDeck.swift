                        All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent
                        instances of superintending providence in our favor. To that kind
                        providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the
                        means of establishing our future national felicity. And have we now
                        forgotten that powerful friend? Or do we imagine that we no longer need his
                        assistance? I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more
                        convincing proofs I see of this truth-that God governs in the affairs of
                        men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the Ground without his Notice, is it
                        probable that an Empire can rise without his Aid?
